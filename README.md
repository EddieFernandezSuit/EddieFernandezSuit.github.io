# Wall Concrete Yards Calculator
Tool I created to help I&J Concrete Inc construciton company that automates the calculation of Cubic yards required to fill a series of connected concrete yards.
To use the tool navigate to the concrete calculator webpage and add any number of walls and fill in the length, width, and height parameters of each wall in the input fields.
It is assumed that each wall is connected to each successve wall and each wall before. This incluedes wrapping around. This means that wall 1 is connected to wall 2 and wall 4 (assumng only 3 walls).
Whats nteresting about this caclulation is that it is not as simple as multiplying each walls length x width x heigth summing each wall. 
This would en up double counting the connected corners.
Instead a more suffisticated algorithm is used feel free to check the source code for that equation. I did not look it up but instead derived it myself.

# HabitHelper
A personal tool I developed for the sole purpose of aiding my morning routine. The tool is designed for specifically my own personal ease of use.

Some tasks require a button to be pressed when completed and others are timed.
